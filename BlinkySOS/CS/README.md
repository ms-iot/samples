This project sample is derived from Hello Blinky project; but instead of using an external LED, it only uses the onboard OK LED (GPIO no 47 on PI 2). By thus, you can have fun with your PI without any wiring needed.

From simply blinking the LED, the application was evolved to do series of S.O.S. blinking. The LED blincking is accompanied by on-screen blinking "lamp" (a UWP page control).

Overall, a practical getting-started programming example.

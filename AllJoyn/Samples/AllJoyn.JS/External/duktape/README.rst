Duktape
=======

Duktape is a small and portable Ecmascript E5/E5.1 implementation.  It is
intended to be easily embeddable into C programs, with a C API similar in
spirit to Lua's.

Duktape supports the full E5/E5.1 feature set including errors, Unicode
strings, and regular expressions, as well as a subset of E6 features (e.g.
Proxy objects).  Duktape also provides a number of custom features such as
error tracebacks, additional data types for better C integration, combined
reference counting and mark-and sweep garbage collector, object finalizers,
co-operative threads a.k.a. coroutines, tail calls, built-in logging and
module frameworks, a built-in debugger protocol, and so on.

You can browse Duktape programmer's API and other documentation at:

* http://duktape.org/

In particular, you should read the getting started section:

* http://duktape.org/guide.html#gettingstarted

Building and integrating Duktape into your project is very straightforward:

* http://duktape.org/guide.html#compiling

See Makefile.hello for a concrete example::

  $ cd <dist_root>
  $ make -f Makefile.hello
  [...]
  $ ./hello
  Hello world!
  2+3=5

To build an example command line tool, use the following::

  $ cd <dist_root>
  $ make -f Makefile.cmdline
  [...]

  $ ./duk
  ((o) Duktape
  duk> print('Hello world!');
  Hello world!
  = undefined

  $ ./duk mandel.js
  [...]

This distributable contains:

* ``src/``: main Duktape library in a "single file" format (duktape.c and
  duktape.h)

* ``src-separate/``: main Duktape library in multiple files format.

* ``examples/``: further examples for using Duktape.  Although Duktape
  itself is widely portable, some of the examples are Linux only.
  For instance the ``eventloop`` example illustrates how ``setTimeout()``
  and other standard timer functions could be implemented on Unix/Linux.

* ``extras/``: utilities and modules which don't comfortably fit into the
  main Duktape library because of footprint or portability concerns.
  Extras are maintained and bug fixed code, but don't have the same version
  guarantees as the main Duktape library.

* ``polyfills/``: a few replacement suggestions for non-standard Javascript
  functions provided by other implementations.

* ``debugger/``: a debugger with a web UI, see ``debugger/README.rst`` and
  https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/debugger.rst for
  details on Duktape debugger support.

* ``licenses/``: licensing information.

commit f23fb1baacb882cc79ab0dc7daa19b9e276de1fa (v1.2.0-54-gf23fb1b).

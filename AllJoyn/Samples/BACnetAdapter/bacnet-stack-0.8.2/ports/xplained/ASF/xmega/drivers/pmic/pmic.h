/**
 * \page xmega_pmic_quickstart Quick start guide for PMIC driver
 *
 * This is the quick start guide for the \ref pmic_group "PMIC driver" and
 * the closely related \ref interrupt_group "global interrupt driver", with
 * step-by-step instructions on how to configure and use the drivers in a
 * selection of use cases.
 *
 * The use cases contain several code fragments. The code fragments in the
 * steps for setup can be copied into a custom initialization function, while
 * the steps for usage can be copied into, e.g., the main application function.
 *
 * \section pmic_basic_use_case Basic use case
 * In this basic use case, the PMIC is configured for:
 * - all interrupt levels enabled
 * - round-robin scheduling
 * 
 * This will allow for interrupts from other modules being used.
 *
 * \section pmic_basic_use_case_setup Setup steps
 *
 * \subsection pmic_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * For the setup code of this use case to work, the following must
 * be added to the project:
 * -# Interrupts for the module requiring the PMIC module have to be 
 *    enabled.
 * -# An Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for a given interrupt vector has to be 
 *    defined, where the interrupt vectors available are defined by toolchain and 
 *    listed in the subsection 'Interrupt Vector Summary' in the data sheet.
 * \code
 *     ISR(interrupt_vector){
 *         //Interrupt Service Routine
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection pmic_basic_use_case_setup_code Example code
 * Add to the initialization code:
 * \code
 *     pmic_init();
 *     pmic_set_scheduling(PMIC_SCH_ROUND_ROBIN);
 *     cpu_irq_enable();
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection pmic_basic_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# call the PMIC driver's own init function to enable all interrupt levels:
 *   - \code pmic_init(); \endcode
 * -# enable round-robin instead of fixed priority interrupt scheduling:
 *   - \code pmic_set_scheduling(PMIC_SCH_ROUND_ROBIN); \endcode
 * -# enable interrupts globally:
 *   - \code cpu_irq_enable(); \endcode
 *   - \attention Interrupts will not trigger without this step.
 *
 * \section pmic_use_cases Advanced use cases
 * For more advanced use of the PMIC driver, see the following use cases:
 * - \subpage pmic_use_case_1 : atomic operations
 */

/**
 * \page pmic_use_case_1 Use case #1
 *
 * In this use case, the PMIC is configured for:
 * - all interrupt levels enabled
 * 
 * This will allow for interrupts from other modules being used.
 *
 * This use case shows how to make an operation which consists of multiple
 * instructions uninterruptible, i.e., into an atomic operation. This is often
 * necessary if there is a risk that data can be accessed by interrupt handlers
 * while other code is accessing it, and at least one of them modifies it.
 *
 * \section pmic_use_case_1_setup Setup steps
 *
 * \subsection pmic_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * For the setup code of this use case to work, the following must
 * be added to the project:
 * -# Interrupts for the module requiring the PMIC module have to be 
 *    enabled.
 * -# An Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for a given interrupt vector has to be 
 *    defined, where the interrupt vectors available are defined by toolchain and

 * \code
 *     ISR(interrupt_vector){
 *         //Interrupt Service Routine
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection pmic_use_case_1_setup_code Example code
 * Add to application initialization:
 * \code
 *     pmic_init();
 *     cpu_irq_enable();
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection pmic_use_case_1_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# call the PMIC driver's own init function to enable all interrupt levels:
 *   - \code pmic_init(); \endcode
 * -# set global interrupt enable flag:
 *   - \code cpu_irq_enable(); \endcode
 *
 * \section pmic_use_case_1_usage Usage steps
 *
 * \subsection pmic_use_case_1_usage_code Example code
 * \code
 * Add to application:
 * void atomic_operation(void)
 * {
 *     irqflags_t flags;
 *
 *     flags = cpu_irq_save();
 *
 *     // Uninterruptible block of code
 *
 *     cpu_irq_restore(flags);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection pmic_use_case_1_usage_flow Workflow
 * -# allocate temporary storage for interrupt enable:
 *   - \code irqflags_t flags; \endcode
 * -# clear global interrupt enable flag while saving its previous state:
 *   - \code flags = cpu_irq_save(); \endcode
 * -# restore the previous state of global interrupt flag after operation:
 *   - \code cpu_irq_restore(flags); \endcode

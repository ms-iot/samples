        <p class="BodyText">Several questions from developers using the OpenZWave library
          have suggested confusion about the meaning of notifications sent by the
          library.&nbsp;This document is intended to
          clarify and document the notifications sent by the library and to indicate what
          information is &ldquo;known&rdquo; at the time the notifications are sent.&nbsp;This will, hopefully, assist developers in
          designing the actions to take upon receipt of each notification.<br>
          <br>
        </p></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><p class="Heading2">Important Note </p>
          <p class="BodyText">You should be aware that notifications are <u><strong>blocking</strong></u>. That is, when a notification is sent to an application, the OpenZWave library will wait until the callback function returns. So, for example, if you put a modal dialog box (for Windows users) in the notification handler in your application, OpenZWave will essentially stop communicating with the Z-Wave controller until the dialog box is dismissed and the notification handler returns. </p>
          <p class="BodyText">This  &quot;feature&quot; may be changed in the future, but for now developers must be aware of this issue. <br />

          presented below lists notifications in the order they might typically be
          received, and grouped into a few logically related categories.&nbsp; Of course, given the variety of ZWave controllers, devices and network configurations the
          actual sequence will vary (somewhat).&nbsp; The descriptions below the notification name (in square brackets)
          identify whether the notification is <b>always</b> sent (unless there&rsquo;s a significant error in the network or software) or <b>potentially </b>sent during the execution

        above), or if a new node is included in the network while OpenZWave is running.<br>
        <br>
        As with NodeNew, very little is known about the node at the time
        the notification is sent…just the fact that a new node has been identified
        and its assigned NodeID. </td>

        <br>
        At the time
        this notification is sent, the new value may or may not have “live” data
        associated with it. It may be
        populated, but it may alternatively just be a placeholder for a value that
        has not been read at the time the notification is sent.

      <td width=432 valign=top class="TableText">Sent
        when a node’s values and attributes have been fully queried.
        At the
        time this notification is sent, the node’s information has been fully read at
        least once.  So this notification might
        trigger “full” display of the node’s information, values, etc.
        If this
        notification is not sent, it indicates that there has been a problem
        initializing the device.  The most
        common issue is that the node is a “sleeping” device.  The NodeQueriesComplete notification will be sent when the node wakes up and the query process
        completes.

          indicated above, when OpenZWave starts it reads
          certain information from a file, from the controller and from the
          network.  The following notifications

        there are some “sleeping” nodes that will not complete their queries until
        they wake up.
        This
        notification should be sent relatively quickly after start-up. (Of course, it depends on the number of
        devices on the ZWave network and whether there are
        any messages that “time out” without a proper response.)</td>

        This notification
        should be sent relatively quickly if there are no “sleeping” nodes. But it might be sent quite a while after
        start-up if there are sleeping nodes and at least one of these nodes has a
        long “wake-up” interval.

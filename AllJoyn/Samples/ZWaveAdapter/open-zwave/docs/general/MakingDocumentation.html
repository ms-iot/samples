        <p class="BodyText">OpenZWave is still under development, and new features, bug fixes and interface changes are being made on a frequent basis.&nbsp; So it's premature to focus too much energy on producing user documentation at this point.&nbsp; However, several users have asked whether there is documentation available. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">So here is a guide to producing your own version of the documentation (such as it is).</p>
        <p class="Heading2"><strong>Doxygen-style comments </strong></p>
        <p class="BodyText">Much of the source code for the OpenZWave library and the OpenZWaveDotNet wrapper has been documented via comments in the .h header files associated with these projects.&nbsp; So, if you're working with OpenZWave in a development environment (which most users will be, since only source code is available at this point), you can find many functions documented  in these files.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The format of the comments is designed to allow an external program, called Doxygen, to produce documentation (for example, a series of .html files) by scanning the project files, interpreting these comments and producing the .html code to organize and display the documentation in a sensible manner. So, to produce the most up-to-date copy of the documentation, a user can run Doxygen on the project folder in question (OpenZWave or OpenZWaveDotNet).</p>
        <p class="Heading2"><strong>Getting and Using Doxygen</strong></p>
        <p class="BodyText"> The Doxygen program can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">http://www.doxygen.org</a>.&nbsp; Versions of Doxygen are available for Windows, linux and Mac operating systems (as well as source code).</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Once Doxygen has been downloaded and installed you can produce documentation by running Doxywizard.exe.&nbsp; If you're new to Doxygen, here are some <a href="DoxygenStepByStep.html">step-by-step instructions</a> for creating OpenZWave documentation. </p>
        <p class="Heading2">Other Documentation Sources </p>
        <p class="BodyText">In addition to the documentation that can be generated with Doxygen, there are a variety of other sources of information on OpenZWave and on the ZWave protocol more generally.&nbsp;Some of these are linked <a href="Index.htm">here</a>. </p>

  NOTICE - Transition to SCONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IoTivity build system is transitioning to SCONS. Although the
makefiles are still available (until v1.0) and some developers are
still using them, they are currently no longer supported. To learn more
about building using SCONS see Readme.scons.txt in the repository root
directory. The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the oc_logger C sample app, first build liboctbstack.a

cd <root>/csdk

To enable logging
make BUILD=debug
else
make BUILD=release

Next, build the oc_logger C sample app

cd <root>/oc_logger/samples/linux

To enable logging
make BUILD=debug
else
make BUILD=release

The logger sample has two options, default logging or
a custom logger that can be supplied by the user application

To run the application with the default logger, run

./debug/test_logging -c 0

To run the application using a built in custom console logger, run

./debug/test_logging -c 1

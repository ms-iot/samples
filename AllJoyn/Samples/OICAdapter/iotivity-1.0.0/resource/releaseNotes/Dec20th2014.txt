Release notes
****************************************************************************
Release date: Dec 20th, 2014.
OS: Ubuntu 12.0.4 and above
Requires boost version 1.55 to build.
Code buildable in gcc 4.6.3 and above.
NOTE: Boost is not distributed but should be installed in the Ubuntu machine.
*****************************************************************************

What is new?

Features:
---------

Device discovery:
-----------------
The device description resource is a virtual resource that provides a representation
that contains information about the device. It provides a standard mechanism to query
well-known device meta-data including but not limited to device id, name etc. Device
discovery feature provides a mechanism to find devices based on specific device-level
attributes.

Samples demonstrating device discovery:
devicediscoveryserver and devicediscoveryclient in C++
ocserver and occlient in C


------------
API changes:
------------

--------------------------------------------
Class OCPlatform (Header file: OCPlatform.h)
--------------------------------------------

***********************
registerDeviceInfo API
***********************

This new API allows server app to provide the device information.

***********************
getDeviceInfo API
***********************

This new API allows client app to find the device and get the device information.

--------------------------------------------
Header file: ocstack.h
--------------------------------------------

***********************
OCSetDeviceInfo API
***********************

This new API allows to set the device information.


------------
Notes:
------------
1. Multiple improvements in active discovery/presence
- Callback includes host information
- Added support to allow more than one presence resource type filter

2. Klocwork issues fixed in C++ samples, SDK and C samples.

3. Multiple bug fixes updated in Jira.

General notes:
--------------
Maximum length of URI supported is 64 bytes (sent from the client)
Maximum length of query supported is 64 bytes (sent from the client)
Maximum length of request from client and response from server for Arduino is is 256 bytes
Maximum length of request from client and response from server for non-Ardunio is is 1024 bytes

OIC base supports Arduino WiFi shield.
This support has been tested with Arduino Mega 2560 and with Arduino 1.0.5 WiFi library.
Please refer to oic-resource/csdk/README file for building OIC base with WiFi support.

C++ Samples
-----------

A basic sample for hosting a resource on a server and a sample for client for discovering resources
are provided here:
Simple server sample location: oic-resource/examples/simpleserver.cpp
Simple client sample location: oic-resource/examples/simpleclient.cpp
Server and client mode (mode type both) location: oic-resource/examples/simpleclientserver.cpp
Simpleserver and simpleclient samples also provide examples for doing POST operation.
Simpleserver also demonstrates slow response case for a GET request.

Garage samples provide usage of OCRepresentation, get/set attribute values
oic-resource/examples/garageclient.cpp
oic-resource/examples/garageserver.cpp

Fridge samples provide usage of constructResourceObject API, std bind
(for mapping request and responses), default
device entity handler, header options support and Delete operation.
oic-resource/examples/fridgeclient.cpp
oic-resource/examples/fridgeserver.cpp

Presence samples provides examples to use presence APIs
Sample with basic presence feature for server side: oic-resource/examples/presenceserver.cpp
Sample with basic presence feature for client side: oic-resource/examples/presenceclient.cpp

Room samples provides examples to use resource collection.
oic-resource/examples/roomclient.cpp
oic-resource/examples/roomserver.cpp

After building the code in oic-resource, executables for samples are in directory named
'oic-resource/samples/release'.
After building the code in oic-resource, executables are in directory named 'oic-resource/release'.

C Samples

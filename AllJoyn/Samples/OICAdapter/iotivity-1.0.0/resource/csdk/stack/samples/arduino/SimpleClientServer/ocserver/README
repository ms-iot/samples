  NOTICE - Transition to SCONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IoTivity build system is transitioning to SCONS. Although the
makefiles are still available (until v1.0) and some developers are
still using them, they are currently no longer supported. To learn more
about building using SCONS see Readme.scons.txt in the repository root
directory. The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Arduino** -- Must be built with the same BUILD mode declared as octbstack.a.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When an Arduino SimpleClientServer application is running, it outputs logs to
serial port. This requires the current user to be a part of the "dialout" user
group permissions on Ubuntu. If your Arduino device is NOT installed at
location "ttyACM0", you must define ARDUINO_PORT to the location it is
installed at. This location will be referred to as <DEV_PORT>.

This makefile relies on "local.properties" at the directory level of the
makefile that generates octbstack.a. Please refer to the README at that level
to determine what definitions are needed for your environment.

To make ocserver in release mode:

	make (arduinomega)
    make -f makefiledue (arduinodue)

To make & install ocserver in release mode, with <DEV_PORT> NOT specified:

	make install (arduinomega)
    make -f makefiledue install (arduinodue)

To make & install ocserver in release mode, with <DEV_PORT> specified:

	make install ARDUINO_PORT=<DEV_PORT>

To make & install ocserver in debug mode, with <DEV_PORT> specified:

	make install ARDUINO_PORT=<DEV_PORT> BUILD=debug

To make ocserver_wifi with Arduino WiFi Shield support:

	make ARDUINOWIFI=1 (arduinomega)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Clean-Up**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To clean ocserver sample app and objects:

	make clean

//  NOTICE - Transition to SCONS
//---------------------------------------------------------------------

The IoTivity build system is transitioning to SCONS. Although the
makefiles are still available (until v1.0) and some developers are
still using them, they are currently no longer supported. To learn more
about building using SCONS see Readme.scons.txt in the repository root
directory. The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------

ArduinoStackTest.cpp contains several logger tests and can be used in an
Arduino sketch.

On Arduino, the logger outputs to the serial port using Serial.print.

Run a serial terminal program such as CuteCom at 115200,8,N,1 to view the
log outputs.

Note: to enable the logger for Arduino, TB_LOG should be defined in
Properties|C/C++ Build|Settings|Tool Settings|AVR Compiler|Symbols
and
Properties|C/C++ Build|Settings|Tool Settings|AVR C++ Compiler|Symbols

Copy logger.c/h and ocstack.c/h, and ocstackinternal.h to the Arduino project
Note: when building for Arduino, force the compiler to use avr-g++ to build logger.c, and stack.c.

Note: when building for Arduino, several warnings are generated when trying to place strings in
PROGMEM
"warning: only initialized variables can be placed into program memory area"
This appears to be a known gcc bug - https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34734

Build notes

The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.

Go to the top directory of 'iotivity' project(Note: should always run 'scons'
command in this directory)

//-------------------------------------------------
// Linux
//-------------------------------------------------
To build release binaries:
      $ scons resource/csdk/stack

    Build debug binaries:
      $ scons resource/csdk/stack RELEASE=false

To enable logging, ensure that
-D TB_LOG
is set in the compiler flags

//-------------------------------------------------
// Android
//-------------------------------------------------
To enable logging for Android, TB_LOG should be defined in the ./jni/Android.mk file as

LOCAL_CFLAGS := -DTB_LOG

//-------------------------------------------------
// Arduino
//-------------------------------------------------
To enable the logger for Arduino, TB_LOG should be defined in
Properties|C/C++ Build|Settings|Tool Settings|AVR Compiler|Symbols
and
Properties|C/C++ Build|Settings|Tool Settings|AVR C++ Compiler|Symbols

Note: when building for Arduino, force the compiler to use avr-g++ to build logger.c.  Or rename logger.c to logger.cpp.

Note: when building for Arduino, several warnings are generated when trying to place strings in
PROGMEM
"warning: only initialized variables can be placed into program memory area"
This appears to be a known gcc bug - https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34734

ArduinoLoggerTest.cpp contains several logger tests and can be used in an
Arduino sketch.

On Arduino, the logger outputs to the serial port using Serial.print.

Run a serial terminal program such as CuteCom at 115200,8,N,1 to view the
log outputs.

arduinologgertestoutput.txt contains the output captured after running ArduinoLoggerTest.cpp

Note: to enable the logger for Arduino, TB_LOG should be defined in
Properties|C/C++ Build|Settings|Tool Settings|AVR Compiler|Symbols
and
Properties|C/C++ Build|Settings|Tool Settings|AVR C++ Compiler|Symbols

Note: when building for Arduino, force the compiler to use avr-g++ to build logger.c.  Or rename logger.c to logger.cpp.

Note: when building for Arduino, several warnings are generated when trying to place strings in
PROGMEM
"warning: only initialized variables can be placed into program memory area"
This appears to be a known gcc bug - https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34734

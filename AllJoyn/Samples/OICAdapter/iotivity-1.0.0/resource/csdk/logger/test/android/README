// NOTICE - Transition to SCONS
//---------------------------------------------------------------------

The IoTivity build system is transitioning to SCONS. Although the
makefiles are still available (until v1.0) and some developers are
still using them, they are currently no longer supported. To learn more
about building using SCONS see Readme.scons.txt in the repository root
directory. The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------

loggertests.cpp contain several logger tests that can be used in an Android JNI app.

androidloggertestoutput.txt is a file capture from running loggertests.cpp in an Android JNI app.

Note:  to enable the logger for Android, TB_LOG should be defined in the ./jni/Android.mk file as

LOCAL_CFLAGS	:= -DTB_LOG

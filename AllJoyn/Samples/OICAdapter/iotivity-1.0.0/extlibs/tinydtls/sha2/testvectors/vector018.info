DESCRIPTION:
    I added this vector after fixing a bug first discovered by
    Rogier van de Pol.  The length of this data set is designed to
    test for that bug or similar bugs in SHA-256 hashes.  The bug
    was an off-by-one bug where I used a "<" test instead of a "<="
    test in SHA256_Final().  Whenever data set lengths were an even
    multiple of 64 after subtracting 55, the bug showed up.  The
    fix was easy, once the problem was fully diagnosed.

    Thanks, Rogier!

DESCRIPTION:
    This test vector came from Brian LaMacchia in his e-mail
    message containing several samples of output from his SHA-256
    and SHA-512 implementations.  My own implementations match
    his output exactly.  The input data data set is the string
    "Rijndael is AES" repeated 1024 times.

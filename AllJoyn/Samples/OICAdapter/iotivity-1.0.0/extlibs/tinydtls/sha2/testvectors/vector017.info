DESCRIPTION:
    Rogier van de Pol notified me that my implementation differed
    with several others on several test data sets he had tested
    against.  This test vector data set is one Rogier provided
    to me that highlighted an off-by-one bug in my implementation
    that affected SHA-256/384/512 hashes where the data set length
    was of a certain length.  In the case of SHA512 or SHA384, if
    the data length after subtracting 111 was an even multiple of
    128 bytes, the bug surfaced.  In the case of SHA256, after
    subtracting 55, the remaining length was an even multiple of 64,
    the bug surfaced.  The fix was simple.  In SHA512_Last() and in
    SHA256_Final() functions,  I simply replaced a single "<" test
    with a "<=" test.

    Thanks, Rogier!

Windows 10 IoT Core sample code
===============
With a UWP UI app you might what a user response in an app to a prompt to delete something, exit the app, shutdown the OS etc. The problem is, that IoT-Core does not support the Popup class. In that context, with app prompts, using a PopUp message box, the app just skips through and does nothing, or may generate an unhandled error. 

This project demonstrates how to have a [Yes] [Cancel] Popup panel with a message with the app awaiting the user response and responding accordingly.

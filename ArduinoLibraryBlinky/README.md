Windows 10 IoT Core sample code
===============

This sample shows a very simple example of building an Arduino Wiring library and referencing it from a C# app. We've added a public WinRT class to the Arduino Wiring project that exposes basic LED control and calls into the functions defined in the standard ".ino" file. The C# project simply references this component and is able to directly use that public library.
